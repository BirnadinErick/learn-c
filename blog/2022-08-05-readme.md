# README

Hey there, how's it going everybody? Welcome to **Assignements** section. In here, you will find
mini assignments I put together to learn C in a brief. These go from simple ➡ complex and even
diving deep within soem real-world application code found in Open-Source-Software-wilds 🤗.

I will do my best to ensure I explain everything precisely and will leave you in no doubt at the
end. I indend to teach C via assignments to better give you a grasp. This was the way that worked
for me when I was getting-off with C, so I thought it would be a way for someone else too 😁.
