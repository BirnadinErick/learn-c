# Briefly let's C üëÄ

## History

In now a days, most of us use computers, even who belong to other fields as well.
But this wasn't the case back in early ages of 60s &amp; 70s. In 60s and [before] early days
computer was only for mathematicians and engineers. Used for miltary purposes, not for household
like we do with our computers!

> This was changed in future late 70s, thanks to **C**.

**C** was created by *Dennis M. Ritchie* in 1970s at *Bell Labs*. You can find more about
[**History of C**](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html#:~:text=History%3A%20the%20setting,of%20magic%20formulas.)
by *Dennis M. Ritchie* himself.

## Technology

It may seem like in now-a-days, you can write program for one platform(OS), then also run that in another
platform without a hussle in majority of programs. But in 60s this was the quite opposite. Due to commercial
reasons, device manufacturers kept proprietory platform-specific runtimes; such that a platform's program
wouldn't support in another.

But, **C**
[turned it down](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html#:~:text=early%20reference%20manuals.-,Portability,which%20scanned%20a%20set%20of%20files%20and%20remarked%20on%20dubious%20constructions.,-Growth%20in%20Usage)
 for once. At the time of creation, **C** is a high-level and
cross-platform(or platform independant) programming language. This made **C** a gem.

:::info A BIG BUT ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
But here's a catch, it ***is not*** now though. Eventhough, you can run **C** authored programs
in different platforms, once compiled that program could run on the platform it was compiled on.

Here is a [comparision](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-vs-python/) of **C** and its successor **Python**.

Thus, **C** source text is portable, not the executables compiled from **C** between different platforms.

## Its Play

**C** although have a little bit of a learning curve, but once you grasp it, it will help in almost any area possible
It is used:

- Linux Kernel
- Windows&reg; Internals
- Anyother Systems Engineering
- Desktop Apps
- Network tools
- Embedded programming

To name a few üìÉ.
