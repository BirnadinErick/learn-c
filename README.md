# learn-c
my self-guide to learn c and a personal reference

## Why?
Of course there are many resources available, made by much-experienced people. But I needed something
I can refer to in short time in my language, so I created this repo. I thought this also could be a place
for me to enhance my skills by **learning from teaching**, good-old-*Feyman* way.

## Quality
This resource is from a c-noob, so this may contain mis-nomers, bad-practices or streaight up bugs. So, please journ with
a awareness.

## What are included?
As the description says,
> my self-guide to learn c and a personal reference
this is a *self-guide*, so tips and tacks I need while developing &amp; a *reference*, thus a handbook if I am stuck somewhere
and links to some concepts if I need a quick recap 😉.

Well, that **is** it. PRs and corrections are welcome and I am looking forward to them 🤩. Hope this helps someone someday, till
then this is me the BE, signing off 👋.

👨‍💻 with 💖 from Jaffna.
